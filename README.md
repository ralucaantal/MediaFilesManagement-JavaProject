# MediaFilesManagement - JavaProject

This Java application allows you to manage multimedia files (.mp3, .wav, .jpg, .png) from specific locations on your hard disk. The application stores the monitored directories in a text file located in the application's folder. It provides a user-friendly menu to add new locations or remove existing ones, without deleting the actual directories.

This application allows the user to view directories on the computer and perform various actions on them (adding, renaming, deleting - actions are performed on references) and view their contents. In each directory, the user can view the file contents and details about them, and can add, rename, delete, copy, or move files from one directory to another. Additionally, the application can generate statistics for each directory.
